traider.io is a new open source ecommerce plaform. Although technically it's led by Eastpoint Software, it's intended to be a fully engaged community project, and we're greatly welcoming contributions from the development community.

Getting started

To get started, you'll need to:

2. Edit for copy online or clone it to your local copy using git (TODO: add more info)
3. Ensure you have nodejs installed locally
4. Ensure you have mongodb installed & running locally (default config expects no authentication on mongo)
5. Resolve the dependancies on other modules by navigating to the root folder of the project in your terminal window and running "npm install" (no quotes).
5. Start the application using the command "node traider.js", also in the app root folder.
6. Open http://localhost:5000/api/products/seed to create some dummy product data
7. Browse to http://localhost:5000/
